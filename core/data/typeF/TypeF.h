* \brief Basic Type with fixed bit information
*
* Following the idea developped in <inttypes.h> (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types#Fixed-width_integer_types), to enhance the portability of population library,
* we define basic type with fixed size.\n
* The nomenclature convention is {U,}{I,F}{8,16,32,64} standing for
* - {U,}: U means unsigned for all  positive values (no negative "sign" allowed)
* - {I,F}: I means integers for all values 0,1,2,3,... (unsigned) ...,-2,-1,0,1,2 (signed) and F means real numbers
* - {8,16,32,64}: 8 means 8 bits information
*
* For instance UI8 is the numbers, 0,1,2,3...254,255.
